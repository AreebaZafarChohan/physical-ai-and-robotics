# Try with AI: RCLPY Integration: Python Client Library for ROS 2

This section provides curated prompts for you to explore RCLPY integration further with an AI assistant. Use these prompts with your favorite Large Language Model (LLM) to deepen your understanding or tackle coding challenges.

## Prompt 1: Implementing a Simple ROS 2 Action Server/Client in RCLPY

**Goal**: Understand and implement the ROS 2 Action communication pattern in Python.

**AI Prompt**:
"Design and implement a simple ROS 2 action server and client using RCLPY in Python. The action should represent a 'CountUp' task where the client requests the server to count up to a specified number. The server should publish feedback (current count) and eventually a result (final count). Include the `.action` definition, the Python server implementation, and the Python client implementation. Provide a brief explanation of each component and how to build/run them."

## Prompt 2: Best Practices for Complex RCLPY Applications

**Goal**: Learn how to structure larger ROS 2 Python projects.

**AI Prompt**:
"Discuss best practices for structuring a complex ROS 2 Python application that involves multiple nodes, custom message types, and possibly a launch file. Consider aspects like package organization, dependency management, code reusability, and error handling. Provide a conceptual directory structure and code snippets illustrating these best practices."

## Prompt 3: Asynchronous Programming in RCLPY

**Goal**: Explore advanced asynchronous capabilities in RCLPY.

**AI Prompt**:
"Explain how asynchronous programming concepts, particularly Python's `asyncio`, can be leveraged in RCLPY for more efficient and non-blocking ROS 2 node implementations. Provide a simple example of an RCLPY node using `async/await` for handling multiple subscriptions or service calls concurrently without blocking the main event loop. Discuss when it is beneficial to use asynchronous approaches in ROS 2 Python development."
