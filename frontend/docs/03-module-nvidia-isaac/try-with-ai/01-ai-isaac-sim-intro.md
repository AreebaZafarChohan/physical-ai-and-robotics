## Prompt 1: Designing a Simple USD Scene in Isaac Sim

**Goal**: Understand the fundamentals of scene composition in Isaac Sim using USD.

**AI Prompt**:
"Design a Universal Scene Description (USD) file for a simple Isaac Sim environment that includes:
1.  A basic ground plane.
2.  A `CUBE` primitive representing a robot base.
3.  A `SPHERE` primitive representing an object for the robot to interact with, placed near the cube.
4.  Specify basic material properties (e.g., color) for both primitives.
Explain the key USD concepts (e.g., stage, prims, properties) involved in creating this scene and how it would be loaded into Isaac Sim."

## Prompt 2: Synthetic Data Generation for Object Detection

**Goal**: Learn how Isaac Sim can generate data for AI training.

**AI Prompt**:
"Explain the process of Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) in NVIDIA Isaac Sim for training an object detection model. Describe the key steps involved, including:
1.  Setting up the scene with target objects.
2.  Configuring cameras and annotators (e.g., bounding box, semantic segmentation).
3.  Applying domain randomization techniques.
4.  Exporting the generated data and its ground truth labels.
Discuss the benefits of SDG for robotics perception development and how it helps overcome the limitations of real-world data collection."
