## Question 1

What is the primary goal of the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component in the Voice-to-Action pipeline?

a) To convert audio signals into text.
b) To synthesize spoken feedback for the human.
c) To parse text to extract its meaning, intent, and entities.
d) To generate low-level robot joint commands.

**Answer**: c) To parse text to extract its meaning, intent, and entities.

## Question 3

Why is "ambiguity of language" a significant challenge in conversational robotics?

a) Robots cannot hear clearly in noisy environments.
b) Natural language commands often have multiple possible interpretations, requiring context or clarification.
c) Robots are not programmed to understand synonyms.
d) Human speech is too fast for robots to process.

**Answer**: b) Natural language commands often have multiple possible interpretations, requiring context or clarification.

## Question 4

What are Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily used for in the Voice-to-Action pipeline, particularly in the NLU phase?

a) Converting speech to text.
b) Synthesizing speech from text.
c) Recognizing intent and extracting entities from spoken commands.
d) Directly controlling robot motors.

**Answer**: c) Recognizing intent and extracting entities from spoken commands.

## Question 5

For humanoid robots, what unique aspect makes Voice-to-Action integration particularly complex regarding action planning?

a) Humanoids cannot perform dexterous manipulation.
b) Voice commands often imply whole-body movements, requiring complex balance and collision avoidance.
c) Humanoids lack sufficient battery life for continuous listening.
d) Humanoids are not designed for human interaction.

**Answer**: b) Voice commands often imply whole-body movements, requiring complex balance and collision avoidance.
