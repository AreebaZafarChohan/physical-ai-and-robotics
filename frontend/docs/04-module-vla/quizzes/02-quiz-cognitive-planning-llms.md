## Question 3

What is "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting" primarily used for when leveraging LLMs for robot planning?

a) To chain multiple LLMs together for parallel processing.
b) To encourage the LLM to show its reasoning process, leading to more coherent and robust plans.
c) To generate a sequence of physical movements for the robot's end-effector.
d) To convert spoken commands into a written format.

**Answer**: b) To encourage the LLM to show its reasoning process, leading to more coherent and robust plans.

## Question 4

When integrating LLMs into a robotic system, the LLM's natural language output often needs to be "grounded." What does grounding refer to?

a) Connecting the LLM's linguistic concepts to the robot's physical perception and capabilities.
b) Ensuring the LLM's output adheres to grammatical rules.
c) Providing the LLM with a stable power supply.
d) Limiting the LLM's vocabulary to robot-specific terms.

**Answer**: a) Connecting the LLM's linguistic concepts to the robot's physical perception and capabilities.
