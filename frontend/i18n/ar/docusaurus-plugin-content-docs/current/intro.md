# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics platform. This documentation will guide you through the core concepts, implementation details, and applications of physical AI in humanoid robotics.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the field of artificial intelligence that focuses on embodied cognition - intelligence that is shaped by physical form and environmental interaction. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces, physical AI systems interact with the real world through sensors, actuators, and complex control systems.

## The AI Spectrum

We categorize AI systems based on their level of autonomy:

- **AI Assisted**: Human-guided systems where AI enhances human capabilities
- **AI Driven**: Semi-autonomous systems that operate with minimal human intervention
- **AI Native**: Fully autonomous systems that function independently

## Key Concepts

This platform covers essential topics in humanoid robotics:

1. Embodied Cognition
2. Locomotion Systems
3. Perception & Sensing
4. Human-Robot Interaction
5. Learning & Adaptation
6. Safety Protocols
7. Ethical Frameworks
8. Open Research
