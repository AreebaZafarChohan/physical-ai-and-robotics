## Question 1

What is a primary benefit of integrating GPT into a robot's control architecture compared to traditional explicit programming?

a) It eliminates the need for any robot hardware.
b) It allows robots to understand high-level, ambiguous natural language commands.
c) It makes robots move faster regardless of their motors.
d) It provides a built-in sensor suite for the robot.

**Answer**: b) It allows robots to understand high-level, ambiguous natural language commands.

## Question 2

When using GPT for robot control, what is "prompt engineering" primarily focused on?

a) Designing the robot's physical structure.
b) Optimizing the robot's motor control algorithms.
c) Crafting input messages to GPT to elicit structured, unambiguous, and executable commands.
d) Engineering new types of sensors for the robot.

**Answer**: c) Crafting input messages to GPT to elicit structured, unambiguous, and executable commands.

## Question 3

To ensure GPT generates machine-readable action sequences, a key prompt engineering strategy is to:

a) Ask GPT to write a poem about the task.
b) Instruct GPT to respond only with a specific structured format (e.g., JSON).
c) Limit the length of the prompt to a single sentence.
d) Avoid providing any examples to GPT.

**Answer**: b) Instruct GPT to respond only with a specific structured format (e.g., JSON).

## Question 4

In an architecture for GPT-robot integration, what is the role of the "ROS 2 Interface Node"?

a) To directly control all of the robot's actuators.
b) To act as a bridge between the robot's control system and the GPT API.
c) To generate the robot's URDF model.
d) To provide visual feedback to the human user.

**Answer**: b) To act as a bridge between the robot's control system and the GPT API.

a) The robot might run out of memory.
b) The GPT model might not understand simple arithmetic.
c) Latency introduced by network communication.
d) The robot's sensors might not be compatible with GPT.

**Answer**: c) Latency introduced by network communication.
