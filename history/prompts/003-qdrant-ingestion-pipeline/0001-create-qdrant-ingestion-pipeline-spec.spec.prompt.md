## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Okay, I will start by creating a new feature specification for the Qdrant Embedding Pipeline. First, I'll determine the branch name and create the necessary files.

Great, the feature branch and spec file have been created. Now I will write the specification based on your requirements.

The specification and the validation checklist have been created. I have reviewed the spec against the checklist, and it passes all the quality criteria.

Now, I will create the Prompt History Record (PHR) for this `specify` command.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new feature specification and branch for the Qdrant ingestion pipeline.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Created the spec file and a requirements checklist.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The user provided a very detailed prompt which made creating the specification straightforward. The process was smooth.
