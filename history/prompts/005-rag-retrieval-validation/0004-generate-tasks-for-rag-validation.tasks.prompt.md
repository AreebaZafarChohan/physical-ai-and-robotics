## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file with a detailed breakdown of the implementation steps for the RAG retrieval pipeline validation feature.

The `tasks.md` file is located at `specs/005-rag-retrieval-validation/tasks.md`.

**Summary:**
- Total tasks: 17
- Tasks for User Story 1: 3
- Tasks for User Story 2: 2
- Tasks for User Story 3: 2
- MVP scope (User Story 1) is clearly defined.
- Parallel opportunities have been identified.

You can now proceed with the implementation of the tasks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed, actionable task list for the feature.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 1 file was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation process was smooth, thanks to the well-defined spec and plan.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
