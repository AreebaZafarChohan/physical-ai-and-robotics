## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

I have clarified the feature specification by asking 3 questions and integrating the answers into the spec. The spec is now sufficiently clear to proceed to the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified the feature specification by addressing key ambiguities.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: The spec file was updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The interactive clarification process was effective in refining the spec.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
