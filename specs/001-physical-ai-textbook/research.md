# Research: Performance Goals for Textbook Website

**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Question

What are the performance and scalability requirements for the textbook website, specifically regarding the target number of concurrent users?

## Research & Analysis

The project is planned to be a static site generated by Docusaurus and hosted on GitHub Pages.

-   **GitHub Pages capabilities**: GitHub Pages is designed to serve static content and can handle a large number of viewers. It is backed by a global CDN (Fastly), which provides low-latency access to users worldwide. For public repositories, there are no strict bandwidth or traffic limits, although usage is expected to be reasonable.
-   **Docusaurus performance**: Docusaurus builds a highly optimized static website (HTML, CSS, JS). Client-side rendering is fast, and navigation between pages is near-instantaneous.
-   **Expected User Base**: As a university-level textbook, initial traffic is expected to be from students of a few courses (low to medium scale, 100-1,000 concurrent users at peak times like exams).
-   **Scaling**: If the site's popularity grows, the static nature of the site means it scales automatically with the CDN. No server-side infrastructure needs to be managed.

## Decision

**Decision**: The project will target a **medium scale (100-1,000 concurrent users)** but will not require special infrastructure. The default Docusaurus build hosted on GitHub Pages is sufficient.

**Rationale**:
-   GitHub Pages is a cost-effective and highly scalable solution for static sites.
-   There is no need for premature optimization or over-engineering a complex backend for a content-focused website.
-   The chosen stack inherently supports a large number of concurrent readers without performance degradation. Performance goals will be met by default.

**Alternatives considered**:
-   **Self-hosting on a VPS**: Rejected due to higher cost, maintenance overhead, and lack of a built-in CDN.
-   **Using a platform like Vercel/Netlify**: These are excellent alternatives and offer similar performance. GitHub Pages is chosen for its simplicity and direct integration with the source code repository. If advanced features like serverless functions are needed later (for the interactive components), a migration to Vercel/Netlify would be straightforward.
