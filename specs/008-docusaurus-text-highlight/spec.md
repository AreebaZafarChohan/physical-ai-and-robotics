## Objective
Enhance the existing Integrated RAG Chatbot embedded in a Docusaurus-based published book by enabling seamless interaction with user-selected text.

## Context
The RAG chatbot is already implemented using:
- OpenAI Agents / ChatKit SDKs
- FastAPI backend
- Neon Serverless Postgres
- Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier)

The chatbot can answer questions about the book content and can restrict answers to user-selected text.

## New Feature Requirement
When a user highlights/selects any text inside the Docusaurus book content, a contextual UI should appear with two options:
- **Copy Text**: Copies the selected text directly to the user’s clipboard.
  - Uses browser-native clipboard APIs.
  - Works across modern browsers.
- **Ask from RoboX**: Sends the selected text automatically to the embedded RAG chatbot input.
  - The text should:
    - Be pasted programmatically into the chatbot’s input field.
    - Trigger the “Enter/Send” action automatically (no extra user action).
  - The chatbot must treat this text as user-provided context and answer strictly based on it if required.

## Functional Expectations
- The highlight menu should:
  - Appear only when text is selected.
  - Be non-intrusive and visually aligned with Docusaurus theme.
- The “Ask from RoboX” flow must:
  - Preserve formatting where possible.
  - Clearly indicate to the chatbot that the content is user-selected excerpt.
- The solution should work with static MD/MDX pages generated by Docusaurus.

## Technical Constraints & Guidance
- **Frontend**:
  - Implement using JavaScript/TypeScript (React if required by Docusaurus theme).
  - Use DOM Selection APIs (window.getSelection()).
- **Backend**:
  - No changes required to core RAG pipeline unless needed for tagging the query as “selected-text-based”.
- **UX**:
  - Must feel instantaneous and frictionless.
  - No modal dialogs; inline contextual actions preferred.

## Success Criteria
- User can highlight any paragraph or sentence in the book.
- Clicking Copy Text copies content to clipboard.
- Clicking Ask from RoboX instantly sends the highlighted text to the chatbot and receives a relevant response.
- Feature works reliably across pages and reloads.
